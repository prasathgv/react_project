# react_project

The web app is built on react , so its requested to have node js installed and the VS code IDE for easy code review
Clone the git repo to your local and open the repo in VS code and give the following command
cd my-app
npm install
npm start
Note: you might face CORS issue while running , to resolve it , go to run(win+R) and provide the below command
chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
new browser with the web security is disabled
open localhost:3000
you can see the form with description, location, full_time provide the values and you can find the table with the job openings available.
Sorting based on ascending, Descending are done to the columns based on alphanumeric for descriptions and date for created_at

# Features Couldnt be done

Pagination is not done because of time constraint, only 5 pages with 10 entries each will be displayed

# Things Accomplished

Being a absolute rookie to react , creating a app and successfully calling the api and dislaying the results in three days time interval is itself is an big accomplishment for me.
